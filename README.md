Elephant Sanctuary is a web project designed to promote responsible and sustainable tourism through an elephant refuge experience. The platform allows users to explore available activities, choose between half-day or full-day tours, and contribute to the care of elephants via an online donation feature.

The site includes a "Support Our Sanctuary" section where users can make donations using various payment methods, supported by a user-friendly interface. I implemented dynamic validation for payment fields to ensure information accuracy before completing transactions.

Key technologies include Angular for application structure, Reactive Forms for managing donation forms, and REST API integration to simulate transactions and data storage. The project was developed using json-server to simulate a local backend environment.

Thanks to its modular structure, the application is easily scalable and ready for future expansion of services. This project demonstrates a commitment to a tourism model that benefits both elephants and visitors, offering an intuitive, functional interface for every type of user.
